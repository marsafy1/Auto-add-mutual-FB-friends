# Auto-add-mutual-FB-friends
A program that auto add suggested facebook friends if you have N mutual friend with them.


# Motivation ðŸ”¥
I used to check all of the friends in the suggestion list, and noticed that I have many suggested friends with big number of mutual friends, so I thought that it 
would be cool if I can automate the process of checking all of the list and add the friends who got a higher number of mutual friends than a value that I choose.
I know that facebook dynamically changes the selectors names and IDs however, I wanted to learn the basics of selenium and do a useful project.
